Solving a murder mystery with Prolog

This Prolog program solves Exercise 2.5.1 from Avigad, Lewis, and
van Doorn's _Logic and Proof_. Its structure parallels the statement
of the problem. It has been tested on SWI-Prolog 7.6.3 for Microsoft
Windows (64 bit). To solve the problem, load the program and issue
the query
   `is_solution(M, V, A, W, Oldest, Youngest).`
